INSTALL NOTES

    Installation should be trivial for supported architectures.  Type "make" to
find out what is supported and then "make os-type" to build.  Ie: you
would type "make sunos" to build sudo for SunOS 4.x.  If your OS is not
in the list try the generic entry.  You may have to add your own OS entry
in the Makefile, it's not hard to do.

    You should read the Makefile and sudo.h carefully and determine which
options are applicable to your site and your needs.  (Although USE_INSULTS
is not defined by default it is highly recommended :-)

    To install sudo on your system type "make install" -- this will install
sudo and visudo binaries, the sudo man page, and a sample sudoers file
(if one does not already exist).  You can also install various pieces of
the package via install-binaries, install-man, install-sudoers.

    Note that to use syslog with the ultrix version you may need to grab
and install pub/DEC/jtkohl-syslog-complete.tar.Z available from
gatekeeper.dec.com via anonymous ftp.  All our decs have this installed.
