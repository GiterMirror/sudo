INSTALL NOTES

1) Run the configure script, ie: "./configure".  Configure will generate
   config.h, pathnames.h, Makefile and visudoers/Makefile.  You shouldn't
   need to hand-edit the Makefiles but if you don't like configure's choice
   of C compiler, yacc or lex programs you may want to.  You can also
   use the --prefix flag to configure to install sudo/visudo in a place
   other than /usr/local (ie: --prefix=/opt).

1) Read sudo.h to enable/disable the options you may or may not want.

2) Type make.  If configure did its job correctly there won't be any
   problems.  If this doesn't work, take a look at the file PORTING for
   tips on what might have gone wrong.  Please mail us if you have a
   fix or if you are unable to come up with a fix (address at EOF).

3) Do a make install (as root) to install sudo.  If you get an error
   about setuid(0) failing, something went wrong with the install and
   the permissions on sudo are wrong.  Sudo needs to run setuid root.
   If you get this message, chances are it's not running setuid root.

   You can also install various pieces the package via install-binaries,
   install-man, install-sudoers.

4) Customize /etc/sudoers for your site.  Read the man page and take a
   look at sample.sudoers to see how to do this.

5) You're done.

A few notes:

a) To use syslog with the ultrix version you *may* need to grab
   and install pub/DEC/jtkohl-syslog-complete.tar.Z available from
   gatekeeper.dec.com via anonymous ftp.  All our decs have this installed
   so I'm not really sure if it's necessary or not.  Regardless, it's
   a nice port of the 4.3 syslogd that backwards compatible with the
   ultrix version.  Highly recommended.

b) visudo will *NOT* use the editor referred to by the EDITOR or
   VISUAL environmental variables unless you define ENV_EDITOR in
   sudo.h.  I like the feature, but it can be a security hole
   if you don't know about it.  If you have EDITOR set to something
   secure (ie: no shells or external commands) in the Makefile or
   sudo.h you don't want to define ENV_EDITOR.  Note that vi (the default
   editor) is anything *but* secure in this respect (and no, setting the
   editor to a wrapper that sets the SHELL envar to /bin/true does *not*
   make vi secure--you can change your shell from within vi).  If you
   leave the default of vi, you really don't stand to lose anything by
   defining ENV_EDITOR.

c) If you have a sense of humor you may want to define USE_INSULTS to
   get the insults from the "old" sudo when you enter an incorrect
   password.  Beware, this feature causes some people to want to throw
   their machine across the room and dash it to tiny pieces.
   Sci fi fans may want to define HAL as well (see insults.h).
