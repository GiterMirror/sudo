INSTALL NOTES

    Installation should be trivial for supported architectures.  Type "make" to
find out what is supported and then "make os-type" to build.  Ie: you
would type "make sunos" to build sudo for SunOS 4.x.  If your OS is not
in the list try the generic entry.  You may have to add your own OS entry
in the Makefile, it's not hard to do.

    To install sudo on your system type "make install" -- this will install
sudo and visudo binaries, the sudo man page, and a sample sudoers file
(if one does not already exist).  You can also install various pieces of
the package via install-binaries, install-man, install-sudoers.

Please send changes, bugs, security holes, and gripes to:
    sudo-bugs@cs.colorado.edu
