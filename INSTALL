INSTALL NOTES

1) Read the Makefile and sudo.h to enable/disable the options you may
   or may now want.

2) Type make and see if your OS is on the list.  If it is just do
   "make ostype" where ostype one of the ones listed (ie "make sunos").

   If your os is not listed, you can try "make generic" and see if it
   works.  You may have to add your own OS entry to the Makefile
   but it's not hard to do.

3) Do a make install to install sudo.  If you get an error about
   setuid(0) failing, something went wrong with the install and
   the permissions on sudo are wrong.  Sudo needs to run setuid root.
   If you get this message, chances are it's not running setuid root.

   You can also install various pieces the package via install-binaries,
   install-man, install-sudoers.

4) You're done.

A few notes:

a) To use syslog with the ultrix version you *may* need to grab
   and install pub/DEC/jtkohl-syslog-complete.tar.Z available from
   gatekeeper.dec.com via anonymous ftp.  All our decs have this installed
   so I'm not really sure if it's necesary or not.  Regardless, it's
   a nice port of the 4.3 syslogd that backwards compatible with the
   ultrix version.  Highly recommended.

b) By default, visudo will use the editor referred to by the EDITOR and
   VISUAL environmental variables.  If you have EDITOR set to something
   secure (ie: no shells or external commands) in the Makefile or
   sudo.h you'll want to define STATICEDITOR so that visudo doesn't
   look at EDITOR or VISUAL.  Note that vi (the default editor) is
   anything *but* secure in this respect (and no, setting the editor to
   a wrapper that sets the SHELL envar to /bin/true does *not* make vi
   secure--you can change shell from within vi).

c) If you have a sense of humor you may want to defined USE_INSULTS to
   get the insults from the "old" sudo when you enter an incorrect
   password.  Beware, this feature causes some people to want to throw
   their machine across the room and dash it to tiny pieces.
