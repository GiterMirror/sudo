Sudo should be fairly easy to port.  The most problematic part is how
set*uid() functions.  For systems that support saved uids you should
define HAS_SAVED_UID.  This means that for most of sudo, it is running
with the effective and real uids set to the uid of the caller.  The saved
uid of 0 is used to do a setuid(0) before exec'ing the command.  If saved
uids are not supported, only the effective uid is set the the uid of the
caller.  If you have saved uids, sudo needs a setreuid() function, otherwise
it uses seteuid().  If you have no setreuid() or seteuid() but do have
setresuid() you can emulate setreuid() with a macro like the one in
sudo.h used for HP-UX.
