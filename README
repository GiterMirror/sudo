This is a completely *unofficial* release of sudo.  As such, please don't
bother rootgroup about bugs in it as their source tree doesn't even include
this version of sudo.  In fact, since I've used indent(1) to make the
code actually readable by my standards, it won't even diff usefully against
their source.  Sorry (but if you've seen the previous coding style...)
The indent.pro in this directory is what was used to format the source.

CU sudo 1.3.1 is mostly a cleanup of the sudo 1.2 code including bug fixes,
portability changes with a few extra features.  See the CHANGES file for
the full scoop.

Note that sudo now uses a "configure script."  You should be able to just
type "./configure" and to generate the Makefiles, config.h and pathnames.h.
Also, sudo options are now configured in sudo.h instead of the Makefile
(although you can override the sudo.h values from the Makefile if you so
desire).  For more info see the INSTALL file.  If you need to make changes,
please send them to sudo-bugs@cs.colorado.edu

Please send bugs, problems, comments, etc to sudo-bugs@cs.colorado.edu
