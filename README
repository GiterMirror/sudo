This is a copletely *unofficial* release of sudo.  As such, please don't
bother rootgroup about bugs in it as their source tree doesn't even include
this version of sudo.  In fact, since I've used indent(1) to make the
code actually readable by my standards, it won't even diff usefully against
their source.  Sorry (but if you've seen the previous coding style...)
The indent.pro in this directory is what was used to format the source.

Note that the Makefile has changed significantly.  Type make and choose
whichever OS type is appropriate.  If there is nothing close, try generic.
If you need to make changes, please send them to sudo-bugs@cs.colorado.edu
