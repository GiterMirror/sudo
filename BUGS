1) Sudo -l does not expand Command Aliases.

2) When doing two sudo's in a pipe, the ticket file update of one
   sudo may clobber the other's, resulting in the second sudo asking
   for a password when it should not.  (May be fixed now...)

3) Under SunOS at least, if the argv is long and takes several syslog()
   calls to log it takes a *long* time before the command is actually
   executed.
