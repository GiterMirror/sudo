Known bugs in sudo version 1.5.9
================================

1) "make install-man" should substitute correct paths into the
    man pages themselves.

2) Sudo should log when removing "dangerous" envariables.

3) configure variables that have been cached cannot be overridden
   in subsequent configure runs, even if other --with-* options are
   given.  This is a flaw in GNU autoconf.

4) Cmnd_Alias's need to precede permissions specs.  At the very least,
   visudo should give an error if you get this wrong.

5) On DUNIX in sia mode, hitting return at the prompt does not quit.
