Known bugs in sudo version 1.4
==============================

1) Sudo -l does not expand Command Aliases.

2) "make install-man" should substitute correct paths into the
    man pages themselves.

3) Sudo should log when removing "dangerous" envariables.

4) User or host names that contain only uppercase alpha, numbers, and '_'
   will be parsed as Aliases (Cmnd_Alias, Host_Alias, User_Alias).
   There is no way to fix this in the current sudo.

5) '*' by itself in sudoers should not match an empty command list?
