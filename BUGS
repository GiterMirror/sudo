Known bugs in sudo version 1.4
==============================

1) Sudo -l does not expand Command Aliases.

2) "make install-man" should substitute correct paths into man pages.

3) When installing binaries and man pages, the Makefile should make the
   directories if necesary.

4) Sudo should log when removing "dangerous" envariables.
