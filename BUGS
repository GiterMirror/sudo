Known bugs in sudo version 1.5.6
================================

1) "make install-man" should substitute correct paths into the
    man pages themselves.

2) Sudo should log when removing "dangerous" envariables.

3) configure variables that have been cached cannot be overridden
   in subsequent configure runs, even if other --with-* options are
   given.  This is a flaw in GNU autoconf.

4) Cmnd_Alias's need to precede permissions specs.  At the very least,
   visudo should give an error if you get this wrong.

5) A user can use sudo to gather information on what executables
   exist on a system, even ones that would not normally be accessible.

6) There is still a bug in the ``sudo -l'' processing code that can
   cause sudo to get a SEGV.  I've not been able to track it down yet.

7) HOST_IN_LOG and WRAP_LOG are changeable via configure but not options.h.
   All the options should really become arguments to configure and
   options.h should just go away (its functionality subsumed by config.h).
