A Brief history of sudo(8):

The sudo philosophy originated at SUNY-Buffalo in the early 1980's.
In the Summer of 1986, Garth Snyder enhanced sudo and released it
to the public.  For the next 5 years, sudo was fed and watered by
a handful of folks at CU-Boulder, including Bob Coggeshall, Bob
Manchek, and Trent Hein.

In 1991, Dave Hieb and Jeff Nieusma wrote a new version of sudo
with an enhanced sudoers format.  This version was bought by a
consulting firm called "The Root Group" and released under the GNU
public license.

In 1996, Todd Miller, who had been maintaining sudo for several
years in his spare time, brought sudo development under the umbrella
of his consulting firm, Courtesan Consulting.  Courtesan remains
committed to a free sudo and is sponsoring another sudo rewrite as
well as continued development of the sudo 1.x code base.  As of
version 1.6, Sudo no longer contains any of the original "Root
Group" code and is available with a BSD-style license.  As there
has been no public release of Sudo from the "Root Group" I've dropped
the `CU' from the name.

sudo, in its current form, is maintained by:

Todd continues to enhance sudo and fix bugs.
