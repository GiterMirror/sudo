A Brief history of sudo(8):

The sudo philosophy originated at SUNY-Buffalo in the early
1980's.  In the Summer of 1986, Garth Snyder enhanced sudo
and released it to the public.  For the next 5 years, 
sudo was fed and watered by a handful of folks
at CU-Boulder, including Bob Coggeshall, Bob Manchek, and 
Trent Hein.

In 1991, Dave Hieb and Jeff Nieusma wrote a new version
of sudo with an enhanced sudoers format.  This version
was bought by a consulting firm called "The Root Group"
and released under the GNU general license.

In 1996, Todd Miller, who had been maintaining sudo
for several years in his spare time, brought sudo
development under the umbrella of his consulting firm,
Courtesan Consulting.  Courtesan remains committed to
a free sudo and is sponsoring another sudo rewrite
as well as continued development of the sudo 1.x
code base.

sudo, in its current form, is maintained by:

Todd continues to enhance sudo and fix bugs.  Bug reports and
fixes should be mailed to sudo-bugs@courtesan.com.
