       ssssuuuuddddoooo allows a permitted user to execute a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as the
       superuser (real and effective uid and gid are set to 0 and
       root's group as set in the passwd file respectively).

       ssssuuuuddddoooo determines who is an authorized user by consulting
       the file _/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_e_r_s.  By giving ssssuuuuddddoooo the -v flag a user
       can update the time stamp without running a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_.  The
       password prompt itself will also time out if the password
       is not entered with N minutes (again, this is defined at
       installation time and defaults to 5 minutes).

       If an unauthorized user executes ssssuuuuddddoooo, mail will be sent
       from the user to the local authorities (defined at
       installation time).

       ssssuuuuddddoooo was designed to log via the 4.3 BSD _s_y_s_l_o_g(3)
       facility but can log to a file instead if so desired (or
       to both syslog and a file).

       ssssuuuuddddoooo accepts the following command line options:

       -V  The -V (_v_e_r_s_i_o_n) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to print the
           version number and exit.

       -l  The -l (_l_i_s_t) option will list out the allowed and
           forbidden commands for the user on the current host.

       -h  The -h (_h_e_l_p) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to print the version
           of ssssuuuuddddoooo and a usage message before exiting.

       -v  If given the -v (_v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e) option, ssssuuuuddddoooo will update
           the user's timestamp file, prompting for a password if
           necessary.  This extends the ssssuuuuddddoooo timeout to for
           another N minutes (where N is defined at installation
           time and defaults to 5 minutes) but does not run a
           command.

       -k  The -k (_k_i_l_l) option to ssssuuuuddddoooo removes the user's
           timestamp file, thus requiring a password the next
           time ssssuuuuddddoooo is run.  This option does not require a
           password and was added to allow a user to revoke ssssuuuuddddoooo
           permissions from a .logout file.

       -b  The -b (_b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d) option tells ssssuuuuddddoooo to run the given
           command in the background.  Note that if you use the

           -b option you cannot use shell job control to
           manipulate the command.

       -r  The -r (_r_e_a_l_m) option is only available if ssssuuuuddddoooo was
           configured with KKKKeeeerrrrbbbbeeeerrrroooossss version 5 support.  It allows
           the user to specify a KKKKeeeerrrrbbbbeeeerrrroooossss realm other than the
           system default to use when authenticating the user via
           KKKKeeeerrrrbbbbeeeerrrroooossss.

       -p  The -p (_p_r_o_m_p_t) option allows you to override the
           default password prompt and use a custom one.  If the
           password prompt contains the %u escape, %u will be
           replaced by the user's login name.  Similarly, %h will
           be replaced by the local hostname.

       -u  The -u (_u_s_e_r) option causes sudo to run the specified
           command as a user other than _r_o_o_t.  To specify a _u_i_d
           instead of a _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e, use "#uid".

       -s  The -s (_s_h_e_l_l) option runs the shell specified by the
           _S_H_E_L_L environment variable if it is set or the shell
           as specified in _p_a_s_s_w_d(5).

       -H  The -H (_H_O_M_E) option sets the _H_O_M_E environment
           variable to the homedir of the target user (root by
           default) as specified in _p_a_s_s_w_d(5).

       --  The -- flag indicates that ssssuuuuddddoooo should stop processing
           command line arguments.  It is most useful in
           conjunction with the -s flag.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo quits with an exit value of 1 if there is a
       configuration/permission problem or if ssssuuuuddddoooo cannot execute
       the given command.  In the latter case the error string is
       printed to stderr via _p_e_r_r_o_r(3).  If ssssuuuuddddoooo cannot _s_t_a_t(2)
       one or more entries in the user's PATH the error is
       printed on stderr via _p_e_r_r_o_r(3).  (If the directory does
       not exist or if it is not really a directory, the entry is
       ignored and no error is printed.)  This should not happen
       under normal circumstances.  The most common reason for
       _s_t_a_t(3) to return "permission denied" is if you are
       running an automounter and one of the directories in your
       PATH is on a machine that is currently unreachable.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo tries to be safe when executing external commands.
       Variables that control how dynamic loading and binding is
       done can be used to subvert the program that ssssuuuuddddoooo runs.
       To combat this the LD_*, _RLD_*, SHLIB_PATH (HP-UX only),
       and LIBPATH (AIX only) environment variables are removed
       from the environment passed on to all commands executed.
       ssssuuuuddddoooo will also remove the IFS, ENV, BASH_ENV, KRB_CONF and
       KRB5_CONFIG variables as they too can pose a threat.

sudo(8)                MAINTENANCE COMMANDS               sudo(8)


       To prevent command spoofing, ssssuuuuddddoooo checks "." and "" (both
       denoting current directory) last when searching for a
       command in the user's PATH (if one or both are in the
       PATH).  Note, however, that the actual PATH environment
       variable is _n_o_t modified and is passed unchanged to the
       program that ssssuuuuddddoooo executes.

       For security reasons, if your OS supports shared
       libraries, ssssuuuuddddoooo should always be statically linked unless
       the dynamic loader disables user-defined library search
       paths for setuid programs.  (Most modern dynamic loaders
       do this.)

       ssssuuuuddddoooo will check the ownership of its timestamp directory
       (_/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_s_u_d_o or _/_t_m_p_/_._o_d_u_s by default) and ignore the
       directory's contents if it is not owned by root and only
       read, writable, and executable by root.  On systems that
       allow users to give files away to root (via chown), if the
       timestamp directory is located in a directory writable by
       anyone (ie: _/_t_m_p), it is possible for a user to create the
       timestamp directory before ssssuuuuddddoooo is run.  However, because
       ssssuuuuddddoooo checks the ownership and mode of the directory, the
       only damage that can be done is to "hide" files by putting
       them in the timestamp dir.  This is unlikely to happen
       since once the timestamp dir is owned by root and
       inaccessible by any other user the user placing files
       there would be unable to get them back out.  To get around
       this issue you can use a directory that is not world-
       writable for the timestamps (_/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_s_u_d_o for instance).

       sudo will not honor timestamp files set far in the future.
       Timestamp files with a date greater than current_time + 2
       * TIMEOUT will be ignored and sudo complain about a
       "preposterous stampfile date".  This is done to keep a
       user from creating his/her own timestamp file with a bogus
       date.

       There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root
       shell if that user has access to commands allow shell
       escapes.

       If users have sudo ALL there is nothing to prevent them
       from creating their own program that gives them a root
       shell regardless of any '!'  elements in the user
       specification.

       Running shell scripts via ssssuuuuddddoooo can expose the same kernel
       bugs that make setuid shell scripts unsafe on some
       operating systems.
