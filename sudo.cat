       ssssuuuuddddoooo allows a permitted user to execute a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as the
       superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers
       file.  The real and effective uid and gid are set to match
       those of the target user as specified in the passwd file
       (the group vector is also initialized when the target user
       is not root).

       ssssuuuuddddoooo determines who is an authorized user by consulting
       the file _/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_e_r_s.  By giving ssssuuuuddddoooo the -v flag a user
       can update the time stamp without running a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_.  The
       password prompt itself will also time out if the user's
       password is not entered with N minutes (again, this is
       defined at configure time and defaults to 5 minutes).

       If a user that is not listed in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file tries to
       run a command via ssssuuuuddddoooo, mail is sent to the proper
       authorities, as defined at configure time (defaults to
       root).  Note that the mail will not be sent if an
       unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the -l or -v
       flags.  This allows users to determine for themselves
       whether or not they are allowed to use ssssuuuuddddoooo.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo can log both successful an unsuccessful attempts (as
       well as errors) to _s_y_s_l_o_g(3), a log file, or both.  By
       default ssssuuuuddddoooo will log via _s_y_s_l_o_g(3) but this is changeable
       at configure time.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo accepts the following command line options:

       -V  The -V (_v_e_r_s_i_o_n) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to print the
           version number and exit.

       -l  The -l (_l_i_s_t) option will list out the allowed and
           forbidden commands for the user on the current host.

       -h  The -h (_h_e_l_p) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to print the version
           of ssssuuuuddddoooo and a usage message before exiting.

       -v  If given the -v (_v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e) option, ssssuuuuddddoooo will update
           the user's timestamp, prompting for the user's
           password if necessary.  This extends the ssssuuuuddddoooo timeout
           to for another N minutes (where N is defined at
           installation time and defaults to 5 minutes) but does
           not run a command.

       -k  The -k (_k_i_l_l) option to ssssuuuuddddoooo invalidates the user's
           timestamp file by setting the time on it to the epoch.
           The next time ssssuuuuddddoooo is run a password will be required.
           This option does not require a password and was added
           to allow a user to revoke ssssuuuuddddoooo permissions from a
           .logout file.

       -K  The -K (sure _k_i_l_l) option to ssssuuuuddddoooo removes the user's
           timestamp file entirely.  This option does not require
           a password.

       -b  The -b (_b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d) option tells ssssuuuuddddoooo to run the given
           command in the background.  Note that if you use the
           -b option you cannot use shell job control to
           manipulate the command.

       -r  The -r (_r_e_a_l_m) option is only available if ssssuuuuddddoooo was
           configured with KKKKeeeerrrrbbbbeeeerrrroooossss version 5 support.  It allows
           the user to specify a KKKKeeeerrrrbbbbeeeerrrroooossss realm other than the
           system default to use when authenticating the user via
           KKKKeeeerrrrbbbbeeeerrrroooossss.

       -p  The -p (_p_r_o_m_p_t) option allows you to override the
           default password prompt and use a custom one.  If the
           password prompt contains the %u escape, %u will be
           replaced with the user's login name.  Similarly, %h
           will be replaced with the local hostname.

       -u  The -u (_u_s_e_r) option causes sudo to run the specified
           command as a user other than _r_o_o_t.  To specify a _u_i_d
           instead of a _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e, use "#uid".

       -s  The -s (_s_h_e_l_l) option runs the shell specified by the
           _S_H_E_L_L environment variable if it is set or the shell
           as specified in _p_a_s_s_w_d(5).

       -H  The -H (_H_O_M_E) option sets the _H_O_M_E environment
           variable to the homedir of the target user (root by
           default) as specified in _p_a_s_s_w_d(5).  By default, ssssuuuuddddoooo
           does not modify _H_O_M_E.

       --  The -- flag indicates that ssssuuuuddddoooo should stop processing
           command line arguments.  It is most useful in
           conjunction with the -s flag.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo quits with an exit value of 1 if there is a
       configuration/permission problem or if ssssuuuuddddoooo cannot execute
       the given command.  In the latter case the error string is
       printed to stderr.  If ssssuuuuddddoooo cannot _s_t_a_t(2) one or more
       entries in the user's PATH an error is printed on stderr.

       most common reason for _s_t_a_t(2) to return "permission
       denied" is if you are running an automounter and one of
       the directories in your PATH is on a machine that is
       currently unreachable.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo tries to be safe when executing external commands.
       Variables that control how dynamic loading and binding is
       done can be used to subvert the program that ssssuuuuddddoooo runs.
       To combat this the LD_*, _RLD_*, SHLIB_PATH (HP-UX only),
       and LIBPATH (AIX only) environment variables are removed
       from the environment passed on to all commands executed.
       ssssuuuuddddoooo will also remove the IFS, ENV, BASH_ENV, KRB_CONF,
       KRB5_CONFIG, LOCALDOMAIN, RES_OPTIONS and HOSTALIASES
       variables as they too can pose a threat.

       To prevent command spoofing, ssssuuuuddddoooo checks "." and "" (both
       denoting current directory) last when searching for a
       command in the user's PATH (if one or both are in the
       PATH).  Note, however, that the actual PATH environment
       variable is _n_o_t modified and is passed unchanged to the
       program that ssssuuuuddddoooo executes.

       For security reasons, if your OS supports shared libraries
       and does not disable user-defined library search paths for
       setuid programs (most do), you should either use a linker
       option that disables this behavior or link ssssuuuuddddoooo
       statically.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo will check the ownership of its timestamp directory
       (_/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_s_u_d_o or _/_t_m_p_/_._o_d_u_s by default) and ignore the
       directory's contents if it is not owned by root and only
       writable by root.  On systems that allow non-root users to
       give away files via _c_h_o_w_n(2), if the timestamp directory
       is located in a directory writable by anyone (ie: _/_t_m_p),
       it is possible for a user to create the timestamp
       directory before ssssuuuuddddoooo is run.  However, because ssssuuuuddddoooo
       checks the ownership and mode of the directory and its
       contents, the only damage that can be done is to "hide"
       files by putting them in the timestamp dir.  This is
       unlikely to happen since once the timestamp dir is owned
       by root and inaccessible by any other user the user
       placing files there would be unable to get them back out.
       To get around this issue you can use a directory that is
       not world-writable for the timestamps (_/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_s_u_d_o for
       instance) or create /tmp/.odus with the appropriate owner
       (root) and permissions (0700) in the system startup files.

       sudo will not honor timestamps set far in the future.
       Timestamps with a date greater than current_time + 2 *
       TIMEOUT will be ignored and sudo will log and complain.
       This is done to keep a user from creating his/her own
       timestamp with a bogus date on system that allow users to
       give away files.
