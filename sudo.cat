[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1msudo [22mallows a permitted user to execute a [4mcommand[24m as the superuser or
       another user, as specified in the [4msudoers[24m file.  The real and effective
       uid and gid are set to match those of the target user as specified in
       the passwd file and the group vector is initialized based on the group
       file (unless the [1m-P [22moption was specified).  If the invoking user is
       root or if the target user is the same as the invoking user, no
       password is required.  Otherwise, [1msudo [22mrequires that users authenticate
       themselves with a password by default (NOTE: in the default
       configuration this is the user's password, not the root password).
       Once a user has been authenticated, a time stamp is updated and the
       user may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5
       minutes unless overridden in [4msudoers[24m).

       When invoked as [1msudoedit[22m, the [1m-e [22moption (described below), is implied.

       [1msudo [22mdetermines who is an authorized user by consulting the file
       [4m/etc/sudoers[24m.  By running [1msudo [22mwith the [1m-v [22moption, a user can update
       the time stamp without running a [4mcommand[24m.  If a password is required,
       [1msudo [22mwill exit if the user's password is not entered within a
       configurable time limit.  The default password prompt timeout is 5
       minutes.

       If a user who is not listed in the [4msudoers[24m file tries to run a command
       via [1msudo[22m, mail is sent to the proper authorities, as defined at
       configure time or in the [4msudoers[24m file (defaults to root).  Note that
       the mail will not be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo
       with the [1m-l [22mor [1m-v [22moption.  This allows users to determine for
       themselves whether or not they are allowed to use [1msudo[22m.

       If [1msudo [22mis run by root and the SUDO_USER environment variable is set,
       [1msudo [22mwill use this value to determine who the actual user is.  This can
       be used by a user to log commands through sudo even when a root shell
       has been invoked.  It also allows the [1m-e [22moption to remain useful even
       when being run via a sudo-run script or program.  Note however, that
       the sudoers lookup is still done for root, not the user specified by
       SUDO_USER.

       [1msudo [22mcan log both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as well as
       errors) to [4msyslog[24m(3), a log file, or both.  By default [1msudo [22mwill log
       via [4msyslog[24m(3) but this is changeable at configure time or via the
       [4msudoers[24m file.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1msudo [22maccepts the following command line options:

       -A          Normally, if [1msudo [22mrequires a password, it will read it from
                   the current terminal.  If the [1m-A [22m([4maskpass[24m) option is
                   specified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is
                   executed to read the user's password and output the
                   password to the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS
                   environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the
                   helper program.  Otherwise, the value specified by the
                   [4maskpass[24m option in [4msudoers[24m(4) is used.

       -a [4mtype[24m     The [1m-a [22m([4mauthentication[24m [4mtype[24m) option causes [1msudo [22mto use the
                   specified authentication type when validating the user, as
                   allowed by [4m/etc/login.conf[24m.  The system administrator may
                   specify a list of sudo-specific authentication methods by
                   adding an "auth-sudo" entry in [4m/etc/login.conf[24m.  This
                   option is only available on systems that support BSD
                   authentication.

       -b          The [1m-b [22m([4mbackground[24m) option tells [1msudo [22mto run the given
                   command in the background.  Note that if you use the [1m-b[0m
                   option you cannot use shell job control to manipulate the
                   process.

       -C [4mfd[24m       Normally, [1msudo [22mwill close all open file descriptors other
                   than standard input, standard output and standard error.
                   The [1m-C [22m([4mclose[24m [4mfrom[24m) option allows the user to specify a
                   starting point above the standard error (file descriptor
                   three).  Values less than three are not permitted.  This
                   option is only available if the administrator has enabled
                   the [4mclosefrom_override[24m option in [4msudoers[24m(4).

       -c [4mclass[24m    The [1m-c [22m([4mclass[24m) option causes [1msudo [22mto run the specified
                   command with resources limited by the specified login
                   class.  The [4mclass[24m argument can be either a class name as
                   defined in [4m/etc/login.conf[24m, or a single '-' character.
                   Specifying a [4mclass[24m of - indicates that the command should
                   be run restricted by the default login capabilities for the
                   user the command is run as.  If the [4mclass[24m argument
                   specifies an existing user class, the command must be run
                   as root, or the [1msudo [22mcommand must be run from a shell that
                   is already root.  This option is only available on systems
                   with BSD login classes.

       -E          The [1m-E [22m([4mpreserve[24m [4menvironment[24m) option will override the
                   [4menv_reset[24m option in [4msudoers[24m(4)).  It is only available when
                   either the matching command has the SETENV tag or the
                   [4msetenv[24m option is set in [4msudoers[24m(4).

       -e          The [1m-e [22m([4medit[24m) option indicates that, instead of running a
                   command, the user wishes to edit one or more files.  In
                   lieu of a command, the string "sudoedit" is used when
                   consulting the [4msudoers[24m file.  If the user is authorized by
                   [4msudoers[24m the following steps are taken:

                   1.  Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited
                       with the owner set to the invoking user.

                   2.  The editor specified by the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or
                       EDITOR environment variables is run to edit the
                       temporary files.  If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or
                       EDITOR are set, the first program listed in the [4meditor[0m
                       [4msudoers[24m variable is used.

                   3.  If they have been modified, the temporary files are
                       copied back to their original location and the
                       temporary versions are removed.

                   If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
                   Note that unlike most commands run by [1msudo[22m, the editor is
                   run with the invoking user's environment unmodified.  If,
                   for some reason, [1msudo [22mis unable to update a file with its
                   edited version, the user will receive a warning and the
                   edited copy will remain in a temporary file.

       -g [4mgroup[24m    Normally, [1msudo [22msets the primary group to the one specified
                   by the passwd database for the user the command is being
                   run as (by default, root).  The [1m-g [22m([4mgroup[24m) option causes
                   [1msudo [22mto run the specified command with the primary group
                   set to [4mgroup[24m.  To specify a [4mgid[24m instead of a [4mgroup[24m [4mname[24m,
                   use [4m#gid[24m.  When running commands as a [4mgid[24m, many shells
                   require that the '#' be escaped with a backslash ('\').  If
                   no [1m-u [22moption is specified, the command will be run as the
                   invoking user (not root).  In either case, the primary
                   group will be set to [4mgroup[24m.

       -H          The [1m-H [22m([4mHOME[24m) option sets the HOME environment variable to
                   the homedir of the target user (root by default) as
                   specified in [4mpasswd[24m(4).  The default handling of the HOME
                   environment variable depends on [4msudoers[24m(4) settings.  By
                   default, [1msudo [22mwill set HOME if [4menv_reset[24m or [4malways_set_home[0m
                   are set, or if [4mset_home[24m is set and the [1m-s [22moption is
                   specified on the command line.

       -h          The [1m-h [22m([4mhelp[24m) option causes [1msudo [22mto print a short help
                   message to the standard output and exit.

       -i [command]
                   The [1m-i [22m([4msimulate[24m [4minitial[24m [4mlogin[24m) option runs the shell
                   specified in the [4mpasswd[24m(4) entry of the target user as a
                   login shell.  This means that login-specific resource files
                   such as .profile or .login will be read by the shell.  If a
                   command is specified, it is passed to the shell for
                   execution.  Otherwise, an interactive shell is executed.
                   [1msudo [22mattempts to change to that user's home directory
                   before running the shell.  It also initializes the
                   environment, leaving [4mDISPLAY[24m and [4mTERM[24m unchanged, setting
                   [4mHOME[24m, [4mMAIL[24m, [4mSHELL[24m, [4mUSER[24m, [4mLOGNAME[24m, and [4mPATH[24m, as well as the
                   contents of [4m/etc/environment[24m on Linux and AIX systems.  All
                   other environment variables are removed.

       -K          The [1m-K [22m(sure [4mkill[24m) option is like [1m-k [22mexcept that it removes
                   the user's time stamp entirely and may not be used in
                   conjunction with a command or other option.  This option
                   does not require a password.

       -k          When used by itself, the [1m-k [22m([4mkill[24m) option to [1msudo[0m
                   invalidates the user's time stamp by setting the time on it
                   to the Epoch.  The next time [1msudo [22mis run a password will be
                   required.  This option does not require a password and was
                   added to allow a user to revoke [1msudo [22mpermissions from a
                   .logout file.

                   When used in conjunction with a command or an option that
                   may require a password, the [1m-k [22moption will cause [1msudo [22mto
                   ignore the user's time stamp file.  As a result, [1msudo [22mwill
                   prompt for a password (if one is required by [4msudoers[24m) and
                   will not update the user's time stamp file.

       -L          The [1m-L [22m([4mlist[24m defaults) option will list the parameters that
                   may be set in a [4mDefaults[24m line along with a short
                   description for each.  This option will be removed from a
                   future version of [1msudo[22m.

       -l[l] [[4mcommand[24m]
                   If no [4mcommand[24m is specified, the [1m-l [22m([4mlist[24m) option will list
                   the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the invoking user
                   (or the user specified by the [1m-U [22moption) on the current
                   host.  If a [4mcommand[24m is specified and is permitted by
                   [4msudoers[24m, the fully-qualified path to the command is
                   displayed along with any command line arguments.  If
                   [4mcommand[24m is specified but not allowed, [1msudo [22mwill exit with a
                   status value of 1.  If the [1m-l [22moption is specified with an [1ml[0m
                   argument (i.e. [1m-ll[22m), or if [1m-l [22mis specified multiple times,
                   a longer list format is used.

       -n          The [1m-n [22m([4mnon-interactive[24m) option prevents [1msudo [22mfrom
                   prompting the user for a password.  If a password is
                   required for the command to run, [1msudo [22mwill display an error
                   messages and exit.

       -P          The [1m-P [22m([4mpreserve[24m [4mgroup[24m [4mvector[24m) option causes [1msudo [22mto
                   preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered.  By
                   default, [1msudo [22mwill initialize the group vector to the list
                   of groups the target user is in.  The real and effective
                   group IDs, however, are still set to match the target user.

       -p [4mprompt[24m   The [1m-p [22m([4mprompt[24m) option allows you to override the default
                   password prompt and use a custom one.  The following
                   percent (`%') escapes are supported:

                   %H  expanded to the local host name including the domain
                       name (on if the machine's host name is fully qualified
                       or the [4mfqdn[24m [4msudoers[24m option is set)

                   %h  expanded to the local host name without the domain name

                   The prompt specified by the [1m-p [22moption will override the
                   system password prompt on systems that support PAM unless
                   the [4mpassprompt_override[24m flag is disabled in [4msudoers[24m.

       -r [4mrole[24m     The [1m-r [22m([4mrole[24m) option causes the new (SELinux) security
                   context to have the role specified by [4mrole[24m.

       -S          The [1m-S [22m([4mstdin[24m) option causes [1msudo [22mto read the password from
                   the standard input instead of the terminal device.  The
                   password must be followed by a newline character.

       -s [command]
                   The [1m-s [22m([4mshell[24m) option runs the shell specified by the [4mSHELL[0m
                   environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified
                   in [4mpasswd[24m(4).  If a command is specified, it is passed to
                   the shell for execution.  Otherwise, an interactive shell
                   is executed.

       -t [4mtype[24m     The [1m-t [22m([4mtype[24m) option causes the new (SELinux) security
                   context to have the type specified by [4mtype[24m.  If no type is
                   specified, the default type is derived from the specified
                   role.

       -U [4muser[24m     The [1m-U [22m([4mother[24m [4muser[24m) option is used in conjunction with the
                   [1m-l [22moption to specify the user whose privileges should be
                   listed.  Only root or a user with [1msudo [22mALL on the current
                   host may use this option.

       -u [4muser[24m     The [1m-u [22m([4muser[24m) option causes [1msudo [22mto run the specified
                   command as a user other than [4mroot[24m.  To specify a [4muid[0m
                   instead of a [4muser[24m [4mname[24m, use [4m#uid[24m.  When running commands as
                   a [4muid[24m, many shells require that the '#' be escaped with a
                   backslash ('\').  Note that if the [4mtargetpw[24m Defaults option
                   is set (see [4msudoers[24m(4)) it is not possible to run commands
                   with a uid not listed in the password database.

       -V          The [1m-V [22m([4mversion[24m) option causes [1msudo [22mto print the version
                   number and exit.  If the invoking user is already root the
                   [1m-V [22moption will print out a list of the defaults [1msudo [22mwas
                   compiled with as well as the machine's local network
                   addresses.

       -v          If given the [1m-v [22m([4mvalidate[24m) option, [1msudo [22mwill update the
                   user's time stamp, prompting for the user's password if
                   necessary.  This extends the [1msudo [22mtimeout for another 5
                   minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to in [4msudoers[24m) but
                   does not run a command.

       --          The [1m-- [22moption indicates that [1msudo [22mshould stop processing
                   command line arguments.

       Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed on
       the command line in the form of [1mVAR[22m=[4mvalue[24m, e.g.
       [1mLD_LIBRARY_PATH[22m=[4m/usr/local/pkg/lib[24m.  Variables passed on the command
       line are subject to the same restrictions as normal environment
       variables with one important exception.  If the [4msetenv[24m option is set in
       [4msudoers[24m, the command to be run has the SETENV tag set or the command
       matched is ALL, the user may set variables that would overwise be
       forbidden.  See [4msudoers[24m(4) for more information.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful execution of a program, the exit status from [1msudo [22mwill
       simply be the exit status of the program that was executed.

       Otherwise, [1msudo [22mquits with an exit value of 1 if there is a
       configuration/permission problem or if [1msudo [22mcannot execute the given
       command.  In the latter case the error string is printed to stderr.  If
       [1msudo [22mcannot [4mstat[24m(2) one or more entries in the user's PATH an error is
       printed on stderr.  (If the directory does not exist or if it is not
       really a directory, the entry is ignored and no error is printed.)
       This should not happen under normal circumstances.  The most common
       reason for [4mstat[24m(2) to return "permission denied" is if you are running
       an automounter and one of the directories in your PATH is on a machine
       that is currently unreachable.

[1mSECURITY NOTES[0m
       [1msudo [22mtries to be safe when executing external commands.

       There are two distinct ways to deal with environment variables.  By
       default, the [4menv_reset[24m [4msudoers[24m option is enabled.  This causes commands
       to be executed with a minimal environment containing TERM, PATH, HOME,
       SHELL, LOGNAME, USER and USERNAME in addition to variables from the
       invoking process permitted by the [4menv_check[24m and [4menv_keep[24m [4msudoers[0m
       options.  There is effectively a whitelist for environment variables.

       If, however, the [4menv_reset[24m option is disabled in [4msudoers[24m, any variables
       not explicitly denied by the [4menv_check[24m and [4menv_delete[24m options are
       inherited from the invoking process.  In this case, [4menv_check[24m and
       [4menv_delete[24m behave like a blacklist.  Since it is not possible to
       blacklist all potentially dangerous environment variables, use of the
       default [4menv_reset[24m behavior is encouraged.

       In all cases, environment variables with a value beginning with () are
       removed as they could be interpreted as [1mbash [22mfunctions.  The list of
       environment variables that [1msudo [22mallows or denies is contained in the
       output of sudo -V when run as root.

       Note that the dynamic linker on most operating systems will remove
       variables that can control dynamic linking from the environment of
       setuid executables, including [1msudo[22m.  Depending on the operating system
       this may include _RLD*, DYLD_*, LD_*, LDR_*, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, and
       others.  These type of variables are removed from the environment
       before [1msudo [22meven begins execution and, as such, it is not possible for
       [1msudo [22mto preserve them.

       To prevent command spoofing, [1msudo [22mchecks "." and "" (both denoting
       current directory) last when searching for a command in the user's PATH
       (if one or both are in the PATH).  Note, however, that the actual PATH
       environment variable is [4mnot[24m modified and is passed unchanged to the
       program that [1msudo [22mexecutes.

       [1msudo [22mwill check the ownership of its time stamp directory
       ([4m/var/adm/sudo[24m by default) and ignore the directory's contents if it is
       not owned by root or if it is writable by a user other than root.  On
       systems that allow non-root users to give away files via [4mchown[24m(2), if
       the time stamp directory is located in a directory writable by anyone
       (e.g., [4m/tmp[24m), it is possible for a user to create the time stamp
       directory before [1msudo [22mis run.  However, because [1msudo [22mchecks the
       ownership and mode of the directory and its contents, the only damage
       that can be done is to "hide" files by putting them in the time stamp
       dir.  This is unlikely to happen since once the time stamp dir is owned
       by root and inaccessible by any other user, the user placing files
       there would be unable to get them back out.  To get around this issue
       you can use a directory that is not world-writable for the time stamps
       ([4m/var/adm/sudo[24m for instance) or create [4m/var/adm/sudo[24m with the
       appropriate owner (root) and permissions (0700) in the system startup
       files.

       [1msudo [22mwill not honor time stamps set far in the future.  Timestamps with
       a date greater than current_time + 2 * TIMEOUT will be ignored and sudo
       will log and complain.  This is done to keep a user from creating
       his/her own time stamp with a bogus date on systems that allow users to
       give away files.

       On systems where the boot time is available, [1msudo [22mwill also not honor
       time stamps from before the machine booted.

       Since time stamp files live in the file system, they can outlive a
       user's login session.  As a result, a user may be able to login, run a
       command with [1msudo [22mafter authenticating, logout, login again, and run
       [1msudo [22mwithout authenticating so long as the time stamp file's
       modification time is within 5 minutes (or whatever the timeout is set
       to in [4msudoers[24m).  When the [4mtty_tickets[24m option is enabled in [4msudoers[24m, the
       time stamp has per-tty granularity but still may outlive the user's
       session.  On Linux systems where the devpts filesystem is used, Solaris
       systems with the devices filesystem, as well as other systems that
       utilize a devfs filesystem that monotonically increase the inode number
       of devices as they are created (such as Mac OS X), [1msudo [22mis able to
       determine when a tty-based time stamp file is stale and will ignore it.
       Administrators should not rely on this feature as it is not universally
       available.

       Please note that [1msudo [22mwill normally only log the command it explicitly
       runs.  If a user runs a command such as sudo su or sudo sh, subsequent
       commands run from that shell will [4mnot[24m be logged, nor will [1msudo[22m's access
       control affect them.  The same is true for commands that offer shell
       escapes (including most editors).  Because of this, care must be taken
       when giving users access to commands via [1msudo [22mto verify that the
       command does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell.
       For more information, please see the PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES section
       in [4msudoers[24m(4).

       http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/history.html for a short history of [1msudo[22m.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
       There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root shell if
       that user is allowed to run arbitrary commands via [1msudo[22m.  Also, many
       programs (such as editors) allow the user to run commands via shell
       escapes, thus avoiding [1msudo[22m's checks.  However, on most systems it is
       possible to prevent shell escapes with [1msudo[22m's [4mnoexec[24m functionality.
       See the [4msudoers[24m(4) manual for details.

       It is not meaningful to run the cd command directly via sudo, e.g.,

        $ sudo cd /usr/local/protected

       since when the command exits the parent process (your shell) will still
       be the same.  Please see the EXAMPLES section for more information.

       If users have sudo ALL there is nothing to prevent them from creating
       their own program that gives them a root shell regardless of any '!'
       elements in the user specification.

       Running shell scripts via [1msudo [22mcan expose the same kernel bugs that
       make setuid shell scripts unsafe on some operating systems (if your OS
       has a /dev/fd/ directory, setuid shell scripts are generally safe).
