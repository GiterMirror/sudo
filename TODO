TODO list (most will be addressed in sudo 2.0)

01) Redo parsing to be more like op(8) with true command aliases where
    can specify uid, gid(s) and part/all of the environment.

02) Add a SHELLS reserved word that checks against /etc/shells.

03) Make the sudoers file accessible via NIS, Hesiod, and maybe NetInfo.

04) Add a -h (?) flag to sudo for a history mechanism.

05) Add an option to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

06) Add Prog_Alias facility (Prog_Alias VI = /usr/secure/bin/vi +args).

07) Add generic STREAMS support for getting interfaces and netmasks.

08) Add support for "safe scripts" by checking for shell script
    cookie (first two bytes are "#!") and execing the shell outselves
    after doing the stat to guard against spoofing.  This should avoid
    the race condition caused by going through namei() twice...

09) Make runas_user a struct "runas" with user and group components.
    (maybe uid and gid too???)

10) Add -g group/gid option.

11) Should be able to mix Cmnd_Alias's and command args.  Ie:
	pete   ALL=PASSWD [A-z]*,!PASSWD root
    where PASSWD was defined to be /usr/bin/passwd.
    This requires the arg parsing to happen in the yacc grammer.
    At the very least, commands and args have to become separate
    tokens in the lexer.

12) Add a per-tty restriction?  Ie: only can run foo from /dev/console.

13) Add test for how to read ether interfaces in configure script

14) Use strtol() and strtoul(), not atoi()

15) Make syslog stuff work on vanilla ultrix

16) Implement date_format and log_format options.

17) Add support for: Default:user@host

18) Make visudo rcs-aware

19) Some people want to be able to specify a special password in sudoers
    in addition or instead of the normal one.  The best argument for
    this so far is to be able to use separate passwords for the
    target users that are not the passwd file ones.

20) Add support for trusted users.  E.g. allow user to run a certain
    command regardless of what dir it is in if it is owned by the
    trusted user.

21) Add a flag similar to '-l' but that spits out sudo commands in
    a format suitable for cut & paste into sudoers.

22) Someone wants a recursive version of the dir specifier.  Ie:
    SOME_MODIFIER:/usr/local/ to allow anything under /usr/local to be run.

23) An option to set the shell to the target user would make sense.
    See other target user-related issues above.

24) Add an option (-D) to dump the defaults after the sudoers file
    has been parsed.  Should only be available to root and should
    allow a -u user modifier.  Maybe dump all of sudoers?

25) For sudo 1.7 wipe out the environment by default.

26) Allow /etc/sudoers to be a symlink but require the parent dir to
    be root-owned and not writable by anything else.  Should really
    traverse the tree to the root doing this.

27) Improve interfaces.c STREAMS code (see ntpd's ntp_io.c for hints)

28) Wildcard support for user and group names? (netgroup too?)

29) If root_sudo is off, still allow sudo -u to non-root users?

30) Use proper links in .pod files

31) Parse gids like %#0

32) For AIX, call getuserattr() to get resource limits and set them
    as appropriate, see:
    http://nscp.upenn.edu/aix4.3html/libs/basetrf1/getuserattr.htm#A16691a89

33) Add an insult_path variable that is intialized to "builtin" but that
    can point to other files containing an insult count as the first
    line and that have a constant record length (sparse files) for
    easy seeking.

34) Some way of using a new pty for the program run via sudo would prevent
    access to the caller's /dev/tty (but probably makes job control tricky).

35) Maybe have a database of checksums that commands are verified against.
    Basically replace the st_ino/st_dev check with a checksum lookup.

36) Look into testing writability of a file via sudoedit *before* doing
    the edit; e.g., try opening with O_APPEND.

37) Add Makefile.in bits to autogenerate Solaris and Irix packages

38) Add monitor support for Solaris using /proc/$$/ctl w/ PCSENTRY
    (use PRSABORT flag to indicate failure).

39) Add a session mode where sudo allocates a pty and logs everything
    that occurs ala script(1).

40) Use pam_open_session() and pam_close_session() (requires a persistent
    sudo process to call pam_close_session()).  Maybe add xauth support for
    the non-pam case?

41) Should "monitor" and MONITOR/NOMONITOR be disabled for non-systrace?

42) Add substitution mechanism in sudoers to subst, e.g. editors for sudoedit

43) Move prototypes to extern.h

44) Get rid of VALIDATE_NOT_OK and just set/clear VALIDATE_OK

45) visudo -c should also sanity check aliases

46) Use AC_CHECK_DECLS for systems w/o proper prototypes?  Maybe errno too?

47) nicer defaults output for "sudo -l" and implement for LDAP too
