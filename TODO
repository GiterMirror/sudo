TODO list

01) Find out why bison -y warns on parse.yacc and fix the problem if it is
	indeed a problem.

02) Add groups of users to the config file.

03) Deal with host aliases rationally.

04) Nestable command aliases

05) POSIX signals (plus emulation where they are lacking)

06) Time out the passwd: prompt

07) Eliminate logline length limit in logging.c and maybe make log format
    prettier.

08) Add uid and gid options to sudo and sudoers file.

09) Redo parsing to be more like op(8) with true command aliases where
    can specify uid, gid(s) and part/all of the environment.
