Troubleshooting tips for CU sudo.

Q) Sudo compiles but when I run it I get "setuid(0): Not owner" and sudo
   quits.
A) Sudo must be setuid root to do its work.  You need to do something like
   "chmod 4111 /usr/local/bin/sudo".

Q) When sudo asks me for my password it never accepts what I enter even
   though I know I entered my password correctly.
A) Try running configure with the --with-getpass option.  After this
   when you build sudo it will use the system's getpass() routine instead
   of sudo's own version.  If that doesn't work, make sure that you
   gave configure the --with-C2 option if your OS uses shadow passwords
   (see the INSTALL doc for a list of OS's that sudo knows how to get
   shadow password info for).
