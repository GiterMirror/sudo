Troubleshooting tips for CU sudo
================================

Q) Sudo compiles but when I run it I get "Sorry, sudo must be setuid root."
   and sudo quits.
A) Sudo must be setuid root to do its work.  You need to do something like
   "chmod 4111 /usr/local/bin/sudo".  Also, the filesystem sudo resides
   on must *not* be mounted with the nosuid mount option or sudo will
   not be able to work.

Q) When sudo asks me for my password it never accepts what I enter even
   though I know I entered my password correctly.
A) Try running configure with the --with-getpass option.  After this
   when you build sudo it will use the system's getpass() routine instead
   of sudo's own version.  If that doesn't work, and your OS uses shadow
   passwords, re-run configure and add the --with-C2 option.  Configure
   tries to guess whether or not you are using shadow passwords but
   it is not bulletproof.
   (see the INSTALL doc for a list of OS's that sudo knows how to get
   shadow password info for).

Q) Sudo says that it cannot read the sudoers file even though the
   path it says is correct.
A) If the sudoers file lives on an NFS-mounted partition that partition
   needs to be exported as root to the host in question unless you
   have set SUDOERS_OWNER to something other than root.  An easy test
   is to see if "cat /path/to/sudoers" works as root.  If not, then
   you have the aforementioned problem.  See the entry for SUDOERS_OWNER
   in the OPTIONS file.

Q) I don't run sendmail on my machine.  Does this mean that I cannot
   use sudo?
A) No, you just need to comment out the MAILER #define in options.h.

Q) When I run visudo it uses vi as the editor and I hate vi.  How
   can I make it use another editor?
A) Your best bet is to enable the ENV_EDITOR option in options.h.
   This will make visudo use the editor specified by the user's
   EDITOR environmental variable.  Alternately, you can change the
   default editor by setting the EDITOR macro in options.h to
   the editor of your choice.
