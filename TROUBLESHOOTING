Troubleshooting tips for CU sudo.

Q) Sudo compiles but when I run it I get "Sorry, sudo must be setuid root."
   and sudo quits.
A) Sudo must be setuid root to do its work.  You need to do something like
   "chmod 4111 /usr/local/bin/sudo".  Also, the filesystem sudo resides
   on must *not* be mounted with the nosuid mount option or sudo will
   not be able to work.

Q) When sudo asks me for my password it never accepts what I enter even
   though I know I entered my password correctly.
A) Try running configure with the --with-getpass option.  After this
   when you build sudo it will use the system's getpass() routine instead
   of sudo's own version.  If that doesn't work, and your OS uses shadow
   passwords, re-run configure and add the --with-C2 option.  Configure
   tries to guess whether or not you are using shadow passwords but
   it is not bulletproof.
   (see the INSTALL doc for a list of OS's that sudo knows how to get
   shadow password info for).
