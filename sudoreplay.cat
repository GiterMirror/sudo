[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1msudoreplay [22mplays back or lists the session logs created by [1msudo[22m.  When
       replaying, [1msudoreplay [22mcan play the session back in real-time, or the
       playback speed may be adjusted (faster or slower) based on the command
       line options.  The [4mID[24m should be a six character sequence of digits and
       upper case letters, e.g.  0100A5, which is logged by [1msudo [22mwhen a
       command is run with session logging enabled.

       In list mode, [1msudoreplay [22mcan be used to find the ID of a session based
       on a number of criteria such as the user, tty or command run.

       In replay mode, if the standard output has not been redirected,
       [1msudoreplay [22mwill act on the following keys:

       ' ' (space)
               Pause output; press any key to resume.

       '<'     Reduce the playback speed by one half.

       '>'     Double the playback speed.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1msudoreplay [22maccepts the following command line options:

       -d [4mdirectory[0m
                   Use [4mdirectory[24m to for the session logs instead of the
                   default, [4m/var/log/sudo-io[24m.

       -f [4mfilter[24m   By default, [1msudoreplay [22mwill play back the command's
                   standard output, standard error and tty output.  The [4m-f[0m
                   option can be used to select which of these to output.  The
                   [4mfilter[24m argument is a comma-separated list, consisting of
                   one or more of following: [4mstdout[24m, [4mstderr[24m, and [4mttyout[24m.

       -h          The [1m-h [22m([4mhelp[24m) option causes [1msudoreplay [22mto print a short
                   help message to the standard output and exit.

       -l [[4msearch[24m [4mexpression[24m]
                   Enable "list mode".  In this mode, [1msudoreplay [22mwill list
                   available session IDs.  If a [4msearch[24m [4mexpression[24m is
                   specified, it will be used to restrict the IDs that are
                   displayed.  An expression is composed of the following
                   predicates:

                   command [4mcommand[24m [4mpattern[0m
                           Evaluates to true if the command run matches
                           [4mcommand[24m [4mpattern[24m.  On systems with POSIX regular
                           expression support, the pattern may be an extended
                           regular expression.  On systems without POSIX
                           regular expression support, a simple substring
                           match is performed instead.

                   cwd [4mdirectory[0m
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run with the
                           specified current working directory.

                   fromdate [4mdate[0m
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run on or
                           after [4mdate[24m.  See "Date and time format" for a
                           description of supported date and time formats.

                   group [4mrunas_group[0m
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run with the
                           specified [4mrunas_group[24m.  Note that unless a
                           [4mrunas_group[24m was explicitly specified when [1msudo [22mwas
                           run this field will be empty in the log.

                   runas [4mrunas_user[0m
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run as the
                           specified [4mrunas_user[24m.  Note that [1msudo [22mruns commands
                           as user [4mroot[24m by default.

                   todate [4mdate[0m
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run on or
                           prior to [4mdate[24m.  See "Date and time format" for a
                           description of supported date and time formats.

                   tty [4mtty[24m Evaluates to true if the command was run on the
                           specified terminal device.  The [4mtty[24m should be
                           specified without the [4m/dev/[24m prefix, e.g.  [4mtty01[0m
                           instead of [4m/dev/tty01[24m.

                   user [4muser[24m [4mname[0m
                           Evaluates to true if the ID matches a command run
                           by [4muser[24m [4mname[24m.

                   Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique string
                   (currently all predicates may be shortened to a single
                   character).

                   Predicates may be combined using [4mand[24m, [4mor[24m and [4m![24m operators as
                   well as '(' and ')' for grouping (note that parentheses
                   must generally be escaped from the shell).  The [4mand[0m
                   operator is optional, adjacent predicates have an implied
                   [4mand[24m unless separated by an [4mor[24m.

       -m [4mmax_wait[24m Specify an upper bound on how long to wait between key
                   presses or output data.  By default, [1msudo_replay [22mwill
                   accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or
                   program output.  However, this can be tedious when the
                   session includes long pauses.  When the [4m-m[24m option is
                   specified, [1msudoreplay [22mwill limit these pauses to at most
                   [4mmax_wait[24m seconds.  The value may be specified as a floating
                   point number, .e.g. [4m2.5[24m.

       -s [4mspeed_factor[0m
                   This option causes [1msudoreplay [22mto adjust the number of
                   seconds it will wait between key presses or program output.
                   This can be used to slow down or speed up the display.  For
                   example, a [4mspeed_factor[24m of [4m2[24m would make the output twice as
                   fast whereas a [4mspeed_factor[24m of <.5> would make the output
                   twice as slow.

       -V          The [1m-V [22m(version) option causes [1msudoreplay [22mto print its
                   version number and exit.

   [1mDate and time format[0m
       The time and date may be specified multiple ways, common formats
       include:

       HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone
               24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm.

       HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone
               24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm, and month and day
               names may be abbreviated.  Note that month and day of the week
               names must be specified in English.

       CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
               ISO time format

       DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS
               The month name may be abbreviated.

       Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and timezone are
       optional.  If no date is specified, the current day is assumed; if no
       time is specified, the first second of the specified date is used.  The
       less significant parts of both time and date may also be omitted, in
       which case zero is assumed.  For example, the following are all valid:

       The following are all valid time and date specifications:

       now     The current time and date.

       tomorrow
               Exactly one day from now.
