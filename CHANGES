CHANGES between sudo 1.2 (unofficial version)

01) sudo now works under hpux, aix, sunos, bsd43, ultrix, linux, osf and irix.

02) Files w/o the executable bit will be ignored if they are in your PATH.

03) If execv() fails, perror is called (which prints out an error based on
	errno) and sudo exits with -1.

04) Included in this shar should also be a version of getpass() derived from
	the bsd net-2 source which works on bsd, ultrix, hpux, aix, and irix
	at least.  The latter three unixes have what i consider to be a broken
	getpass() in that if /dev/tty can't be opened it doesn't just use stdin
	like bsd getpass().  This means you cannot do: rsh host "sudo command"
	and have it work if your ticket has expired.

05) The Makefile has changed significantly.  It now has defines for all
	supported architectures.

06) Changed MAXCOMMANDLENGTH from 48 bytes to MAXPATHLEN and included
	sys/param.h where appropriate.

07) Rewrote the code that expands links & paths.  It now works correctly.
	(rewrote find_path.c)

08) Added a define NEED_STRDUP so we don't conflict with the system's strdup(3)

09) Now does *not* pass LD_* environmental vars on to programs that get
	exec'd.  Also removes SHLIB_PATH for hpux and _RLD_* for dec osf.

10) Now searches current dir last if '.' or '' are in PATH.  Misses braindeath
    like './' but if that's in your path you deserve all the trojans you get.

11) Added in linux patches from drew + flex support.

12) Added insults back in from original sudo(8) (define USE_INSULTS).

13) visudo now uses EDITOR envar (from John_Rouillard@dl5000.bc.edu)

14) you can now specify a dir containing commands that a sudoer can do.

15) Ported to Solaris 2.x (based on a port of sudo 1.1 done by UnixOps).

16) Took out setuid(0); setruid(uid); pairs that bracketed calls to
    update_timestamp() since they are unnecesary and setruid() is
    broken on systems without a setreuid(2) or setresuid(2) system call.
    (Ie: AIX and Solaris 2.x).
