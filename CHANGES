CHANGES between sudo 1.2 (unofficial version)

01) sudo now works under hpux, aix, sunos, bsd43, ultrix, linux, osf and irix.

02) Files w/o the executable bit will be ignored if they are in your PATH.

03) If execv() fails, perror is called (which prints out an error based on
	errno) and sudo exits with -1.

04) Included in this shar should also be a version of getpass() derived from
	the bsd net-2 source which works on bsd, ultrix, hpux, aix, and irix
	at least.  The latter three unixes have what i consider to be a broken
	getpass() in that if /dev/tty can't be opened it doesn't just use stdin
	like bsd getpass().  This means you cannot do: rsh host "sudo command"
	and have it work if your ticket has expired.

05) The Makefile has changed significantly.  It now has defines for all
	supported architectures.

06) Changed MAXCOMMANDLENGTH from 48 bytes to MAXPATHLEN and included
	sys/param.h where appropriate.

07) Rewrote the code that expands links & paths.  It now works correctly.
	(rewrote find_path.c)

08) Added a define NEED_STRDUP so we don't conflict with the system's strdup(3)

09) Now does *not* pass LD_* environmental vars on to programs that get
	exec'd.  Also removes SHLIB_PATH for hpux and _RLD_* for dec osf.

10) Now searches current dir last if '.' or '' are in PATH.  Misses braindeath
    like './' but if that's in your path you deserve all the trojans you get.

11) Added in linux patches from drew + flex support.

12) Added insults back in from original sudo(8) (define USE_INSULTS).

13) visudo now uses EDITOR envar (from John_Rouillard@dl5000.bc.edu)

14) you can now specify a dir containing commands that a sudoer can do.
    (from John_Rouillard@dl5000.bc.edu)

15) Ported to Solaris 2.x (based on a port of sudo 1.1 done by UnixOps).

16) Took out setuid(0); setruid(uid); pairs that bracketed calls to
    update_timestamp() since they are unnecesary and setruid() is
    broken on systems without a setreuid(2) or setresuid(2) system call.
    (Ie: AIX and Solaris 2.x).

17) The bulk of sudo now runs with the caller's real uid.  Grep for
    be_root() to find the exceptions.

CHANGES between sudo 1.3

18) Added SECURE_PATH as suggested by russells@ccu1.auckland.ac.nz.

19) Reworked clean_envp() to modify environ (not envp) so we can use
    execvp() safely.

20) Now use execvp() instead of execve() so sudo /bin/kill works under
    broken solaris.  This also fixed sudo /etc/fastboot under stock
    4.3 BSD.  Basically, this means that any executable shell script that
    lacks a '#!/bin/sh' magic number will now work with sudo.  Personally
    I think that the broken scripts should be fixed rather than changing
    sudo, but vendors will be broken.  Sigh.

21) Added USE_EXECV define so you can make sudo use execv() if you
    want.  Using execvp() shouldn't be a problem since it is always
    handed a non-relative path that begins with '/' but some people
    may not trust execvp().

22) Log file lines will no longer get truncated.  Syslog entries that
    would overrun the syslog(3) line limit are continued on another entry.

23) When logging to a log file, long entries are indented to improve
    readability.

24) Whenever the umask is changed, it is changed back to what it was
    before.

25) Log file is written as mode 600 instead of 644

26) Umask that sudo runs with may now be specified.

27) There is now a "configure" script.
