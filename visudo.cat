       vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo edits the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file in a safe fashion, analogous
       to _v_i_p_w(8).  vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo locks the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file against
       multiple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks,
       and checks for parse errors.  If the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file is
       currently being edited you will receive a message to try
       again later.  In the default configuration, the _v_i(1)
       editor is used, but there is a compile time option to
       allow use of whatever editor the environment variables
       EDITOR or VISUAL are set to.

       vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo parses the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file after the edit and will not
       save the changes if there is a syntax error.  Upon finding
       an error, a message will be printed stating the line
       _n_u_m_b_e_r(s) that the error occurred on and the user will
       receive the "What now?" prompt.  At this point the user
       may enter "e" to re-edit the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file, enter "x" to
       exit without saving the changes, or "Q" to quit and save
       changes.  The "Q" option should be used with extreme care
       because if vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo believes there to be a parse error, so
       will ssssuuuuddddoooo and no one will be able to execute ssssuuuuddddoooo again
       until the error is fixed.  Any other command at this
       prompt will print a short help message.  When editing the
       _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file after a parse error has been detected the
       cursor will be placed on the line where the error occurred
       (if the editor supports this feature).

       vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo accepts the following command line option:

       -V  The -V (version) option causes vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo to print the
           version number and exit.

       Due to the syntax of the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file, there is no way for
       vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo to tell the difference between a mistyped
       {Host,User,Cmnd}_Alias and a user or host name.

       There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root
       shell if the editor used by vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo allows shell escapes.
